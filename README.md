# 👋 Hey, I'm Vikash Vishwakarma  

I'm a B.Tech 3rd-year student who’s pretty hooked on how **Artificial Intelligence** actually works —  
not just the buzzword type, but the real math and logic behind it.  

I’m not claiming to be a pro yet, but every project I build teaches me something new —  
and that’s what keeps me going.  

---

### 🌱 What I’m up to these days
- Learning **Deep Learning** and **Data Science** (slowly, but consistently 😅)  
- Trying to build small AI models and visualize how they think  
- Reading about real-world ML applications and where they actually make sense  
- Cleaning messy datasets (because someone has to 😆)  

---

### ⚙️ Tools I use the most
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Web:** HTML, CSS, Flask  
- **Database:** MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Others:** Git, GitHub, VS Code  

---

### 🚀 Goals (that I actually care about)
- Build something that genuinely helps someone, not just a college project  
- Deploy at least one working ML model online  
- Get better at writing clean, readable code  
- Maybe start contributing to open-source once I stop breaking my own code 😅
